 There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among 
 letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary,
 where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.

Example 1:
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]

The correct order is: "wertf".

Example 2:
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "z",
  "x"
]

The correct order is: "zx".

Example 3:
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
]

The order is invalid, so return "".

Note:

    You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
    You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
    If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
    There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.



Method: Topological sort

First, build a degree map for each character in all the words:

w:0
r:0
t:0
f:0
e:0

Then build the hashmap by comparing the adjacent words, the first character that is different between two adjacent words 
reflect the lexicographical order. For example:

 "wrt",
 "wrf",
    first different character is 3rd letter, so t comes before f

 "wrf",
 "er",
    first different character is 1rd letter, so w comes before e

The characters in set come after the key. x->y means letter x comes before letter y. x -> set: y,z,t,w means x comes 
before all the letters in the set. The final HashMap “map” looks like.

t -> set: f    
w -> set: e
r -> set: t
e -> set: r

and final HashMap “degree” looks like, the number means “how many letters come before the key”:

w:0
r:1
t:1
f:1
e:1

Then use Kahn’s aglorithm to do topological sort. This is essentially BFS.

indegree: Map<Integer, Integer> indegree, which stores the count of numbers that have higher level of the key
priority map: Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> map, which stores the numbers that have lower level of the key

Given a grid where each entry is only 0 or 1, find the number of corner rectangles.

A corner rectangle is 4 distinct 1s on the grid that form an axis-aligned rectangle. Note that only the corners need to have the 
value 1. Also, all four 1s used must be distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one corner rectangle, with corners grid[1][2], grid[1][4], grid[3][2], grid[3][4].

 

Example 2:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]
Output: 9
Explanation: There are four 2x2 rectangles, four 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles, and one 3x3 rectangle.

 

Example 3:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1, 1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Rectangles must have four distinct corners.

 

Note:

    The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 200].
    Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
    The number of 1s in the grid will be at most 6000.


        
Method : This is a good example of how to use HashMap to record row/column index posiiton in matrix.
Intuition

We ask the question: for each additional row, how many more rectangles are added?

For each pair of 1s in the new row (say at new_row[i] and new_row[j]), we could create more rectangles where that pair forms the base. 
The number of new rectangles is the number of times some previous row had row[i] = row[j] = 1.

Algorithm

Let's maintain a count count[i, j], the number of times we saw row[i] = row[j] = 1. When we process a new row, for every pair 
new_row[i] = new_row[j] = 1, we add count[i, j] to the answer, then we increment count[i, j].



    Time Complexity: O(R*C*C)O where R,CR, CR,C is the number of rows and columns.

    Space Complexity: O(C^2) in additional space.

class Solution {
    public int countCornerRectangles(int[][] grid) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int[] row : grid){
            for (int c1 = 0; c1 < row.length - 1; c1++){
                if (row[c1] == 1){
                     for (int c2 = c1 + 1; c2 < row.length; c2++){
                         if (row[c2] == 1){
                             int pos = c1 * row.length + c2;
                             int count = map.getOrDefault(pos, 0);
                             ans += count;
                             map.put(pos, count+1);
                         }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

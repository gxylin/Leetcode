Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a subarray 
of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return -1 instead.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7, the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

Challenge 
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).

Method 1: two points, sliding window

Differnt from Leetcode 862 which could be negative integer
https://github.com/optimisea/Leetcode/blob/master/Java/862_Shortest.java

time complexity: O(n)
class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int s, int[] nums) {
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        while (end < nums.length){
            sum += nums[end];
            end++;
            while (sum >= s && start < end){
                ans = Math.min(ans, end - start);
                sum -= nums[start];
                start++;
            }
        }
        if (ans == Integer.MAX_VALUE){
            return 0;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
